In the context of NPM (Node Package Manager) packages, "optional" dependencies are those that are not strictly required for the core functionality of a package.  If an optional dependency fails to install, or if it's not present at runtime, the main package should still function correctly, albeit potentially with reduced functionality or without certain features.  NPM allows you to specify dependencies as optional in your `package.json` file.  This is useful for dependencies that:

*   Provide enhanced features but are not essential.
*   Are platform-specific and might not be available on all systems.
*   Are used for development or testing but not needed in production.

If an optional dependency is not installed, NPM will issue a warning but will continue the installation process.  Your code should then gracefully handle the absence of the optional dependency, perhaps by providing fallback behavior or disabling the related feature.

**Refined for FHIR Packages:**

The concept of "optional" dependencies translates somewhat differently in the context of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) packages, particularly when dealing with Implementation Guides (IGs) and their dependencies. While FHIR packages don't use NPM directly, the underlying principles are similar.

In FHIR, "optional" can refer to a few different things:

1.  **Optional *Conformance Resources* within an IG:**  An IG might define certain StructureDefinitions, ValueSets, CodeSystems, etc., as optional.  This means that systems conforming to the IG are not required to implement or support these specific resources.  They can still be conformant even if they don't handle the optional elements.  This is usually indicated within the IG's documentation and expressed using cardinality (e.g., 0..* instead of 1..*).

2.  **Optional *Dependencies* between IGs:**  One IG might depend on another IG, but that dependency could be optional.  This means that systems implementing the first IG might choose to also implement the second IG to gain access to its definitions and resources, but it's not strictly required.  This is analogous to optional dependencies in NPM, where the main IG can function without the optional one, but certain features might be limited.  How this is formally expressed is still evolving in the FHIR ecosystem.

3.  **Optional *Resources* within a *profile*:** A profile built on a base resource might mark some elements as optional.  This is similar to optional conformance resources.  Systems using the profile are not required to populate or handle these optional elements.

It's important to note that the mechanisms for specifying optionality in FHIR are not as standardized as in NPM.  IG authors typically use narrative text and cardinality in their documentation to convey which parts of the IG are optional.  Formal mechanisms for expressing optional IG dependencies are still under development.  Therefore, careful reading of the IG documentation is essential to understand what is considered "optional" in a specific FHIR context.
