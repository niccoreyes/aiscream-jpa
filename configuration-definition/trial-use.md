The server only loads resources with a status of 'active' and excludes 'draft'. This is because 'draft' resources are under development and may not be ready for normal use. Their content may change, and there is no guarantee that the version element associated with the artifact is established. Therefore, loading 'draft' resources could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the system. By only loading 'active' resources, the server ensures that it is working with stable and reliable data.  While Implementation Guides (IGs) marked as "Trial Use" have undergone rigorous review, ballot, and are officially published, they are *not* equivalent to 'active' for the purposes of this server's default loading behavior.  "Trial Use" indicates the IG is considered ready for production use and represents an official standard, but it also acknowledges that widespread, diverse real-world implementation experience is still being gathered.  This means future FHIR versions might introduce changes to "Trial Use" content that are not backward compatible.  Therefore, while "Trial Use" IGs are published and suitable for production systems, the server's default configuration prioritizes stability by only loading resources explicitly marked as 'active'.  This prevents the server from relying on specifications that, while officially approved, are still subject to potential evolution based on practical implementation feedback.  To load a "Trial Use" IG, specific server configuration would be required, acknowledging the potential for future, non-backward compatible changes.
